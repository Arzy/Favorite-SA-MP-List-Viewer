Favorite-SA-MP-List-Viewer : USERDAT.DAT
===========

This repo contains some code to open the USERDAT.DAT file of SAMP.

This file is generally located in this path :

```C:\Users\USER\Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files\SAMP\USERDATA.DAT```

USERDAT.DAT contains the list of your favorite SA-MP servers. Servers that you have added with your SA-MP client !

I wanted to be able to see that list since I will use it in my main project : Dancing Plastic.

I used this as documentation : http://sasuke78200.free.fr/samp/doc/userdata.html

If you have any suggestion, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
